### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Khaled, a distinguished graduate with a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science from Homs University, where I excelled academically. I possess a profound passion and advanced expertise in the field of computer vision and deep learning, with a particular focus on the development and application of neural generative models. My research interests center on advanced image analysis using state-of-the-art artificial intelligence techniques, emphasizing the extraction of fundamental features from images and the generation of new images adhering to predefined conditions and specifications. Additionally, I have specialized expertise in the processing and analysis of medical images, contributing to enhanced diagnostic accuracy and the development of innovative healthcare applications.

I am deeply invested in the domain of generative arts, including the creation of facial images with precise specifications and the generation of three-dimensional imagery using cutting-edge technologies. To continuously advance my knowledge and refine my skills, I engage in rigorous academic pursuits, reviewing and analyzing two research papers weekly in the field of computer vision, with a particular emphasis on generative models and their applications.

Furthermore, my work extends to the analysis and detection of motion, with a specific focus on early prediction of future movements, paving the way for groundbreaking applications in advanced computer vision.
